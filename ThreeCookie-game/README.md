This project created in [low-effort-jam-22](https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-22) for the theme `Three`

## ThreeeCookie

A clicker game, demo version. Special design for the theme is the numbers in the game are base on "3", even the timer cycle is 3 seconds.

This is the first time I use my idle-framework with html-subproject. This project is a short demo version for testing the idle-framework abilities and the html exported. 

### release

Desktop: Run desktop-subproject java main.

Web: [Online play](TODO)

### How to play

- Some constructions are free. Click and gain its output.

- Area-change-button is on the right border. You can change to different area.

- Some constructions can switch working-level by "+" / "-" button. You can enable 1-level seller and gain coins. 

- Upgrade constructions if your can afford its upgrade-cost. And constructions only work if your can afford its auto-work-cost.
